# Lab 2 HTML

## Instructions

Open your code editor (VS Code, Sublime, Atom, etc.).
- Create a new folder for the project, e.g., html_lab_2.
- For each exercise, create a separate HTML file:
    - exercise1.html
    - exercise2.html
    - exercise3.html
    - exercise4.html

- Work on each file individually, following the exercise instructions below.

## Exercise 1: Personal Profile Page  
Create a basic **profile page** with:  
- Proper structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`  
- A `<title>` in the head section (e.g., “My Profile”)  
- A main heading (`<h1>`) with your name  
- A short **bio paragraph** (`<p>`) describing yourself  
- Two smaller headings (`<h2>`) for “Hobbies” and “Skills” with lists under them:  
  - Unordered list (`<ul>`) for hobbies  
  - Ordered list (`<ol>`) for skills  


## Exercise 2: Links, Media, and Navigation  
Expand your profile page by adding:  
- A **navigation bar** at the top using links (`<a>`) → e.g., “Home | About | Contact”  
- A **link** to your favorite external website (open in a new tab using `target="_blank"`)  
- An **image** (`<img>`) with an `alt` description  
- An **audio player** (`<audio controls>`) with a sample file or placeholder link  
- A **video player** (`<video controls>`) with a sample file or YouTube embed (iframe)  


## Exercise 3: Tables and Semantic HTML  
Add a **new section** “Education” with:  
- A **table** listing your subjects/courses:  
  - 3 columns: “Subject”, “Teacher”, “Grade”  
  - At least 3 rows of data  
- Use `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`  
- Add a “Contact Info” section using **semantic tags**:  
  - `<address>` with your email and city  
  - `<blockquote>` with your favorite quote  
  - `<abbr>` for at least one abbreviation (e.g., HTML = HyperText Markup Language)  


## Exercise 4: Forms and Advanced Inputs  
Create a **contact form** at the bottom of your page:  
- Inputs for:  
  - Name (`<input type="text">`)  
  - Email (`<input type="email">`)  
  - Age (`<input type="number">`)  
  - Birthday (`<input type="date">`)  
- A **dropdown menu** (`<select>`) with at least 3 options  
- A group of **radio buttons** (e.g., Gender: Male/Female/Other)  
- A group of **checkboxes** (e.g., Interests: Coding, Music, Sports)  
- A **textarea** for a message  
- A **submit button**  

## Exercise 5: Multi-Page Mini Website

Create a multi-page website connecting all previous exercises:

- Create separate pages: index.html, about.html, contact.html, linking them with a navigation bar on each page

- Include consistent headers and footers across all pages

- Add a list of projects or portfolio items with images and links on the about.html page
- Include a table of skills and experience on the index.html page
- Enhance the contact form from Exercise 4 by adding:
    - Placeholder text in inputs
    - Group inputs using <fieldset> and <legend>
    - Add a reset button in addition to submit
